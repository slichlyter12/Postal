[Wed 2016-10-19]
09:31 - Our second meeting and everyone else is late
09:31 - I should not come to the next meeting on time
09:33 - Today I think we want to get a general timeline, and maybe work on the problem statement and get a better look at the documentation for visual code. 
09:48 - start
09:53 - "Enforces organization, allows to write code to other files or quickly place code, quick and visual navigation" -Eric Winkler
[Wed 2016-10-19]
10:03 - Enforce organization with location tag system, and a configuration system, not a wizard, but an initial set up a configuration sthing. Static analysis, tage manager, a GUI
10:05 - For the quick place code we wouwould need a loacation tag system a tag manager and a smart cut & paste.
10:06 - For the visulat navigation we need a visualization of the code structure an d a quick GUI Navigation. 
10:07 - We have decided to start with C. We all know that language annd it won't change and we won't have to deal with classes just yet.
10:07 - logit -out
10:07 - logit
10:19 - lets start coding
10:19 - -
10:19 - -
10:22 - Okay we are thinking about doing HTML and websites
10:28 - I found a good website that describes a 'hello world' - https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/extensions/example-hello-world
10:30 - 
10:42 - installed a code generator with 'npm install -g yo generator-code' 
10:42 - Then I ran the command code with the command 'yo code' 
10:43 - it led me through the creation instructions was made the skeleton of a code extention
10:46 - I opened the generated code in VS Code 
10:48 - Then I started debugging the code with F5
10:54 - Then running the Hello World command on the new Extension Developement Host window I was able to do the shift+command+P and run the hello world command and it printed out "Hello World!"
10:54 - *
10:55 - So while I was doing that Zach and Eric chose to do basic HTMl JS and CSS organizer. This will be good? 
10:57 - * Developement * 
10:59 - looking at the code there are a lot of pieces
11:04 - made a new branch 
11:12 - We are now doing HTML and we are going to strip the JS and the CSS
11:12 - We will have an exception list 
11:12 - looking at srcs and user's exceptions
11:13 - we need to keep in mind that we will be adding exceptions with continued developement
11:14 - For the CSS we are going to optimize styles 
11:14 - IDs vs. Classes 
11:15 - Look for the CSS style on the different blocks that might have similiar styles and merge them together.
11:16 - We will need a huge amount of parsing. 'smart parsing' 
11:17 - Style Combination
11:18 - CSS has no exceptions...? But maybe
11:19 - For JS parser, what is the best design practices for JS
11:19 - move all variable declarations to the top of the file
11:20 - or at least the globals 
11:26 - We will just be doing HTML and CSS to begin with at the moment
11:27 - "Websites can get messy, this makes it cleaner" -Eric Winkler
11:30 - Do we need to add PHP
11:32 - yes but later? 
11:33 - If We do PHP I think we might as well do C
11:34 - We got HTML in our HTML in out HTML
11:34 - Web stuff can be done so many ways! 
11:35 - HTML. CSS. JavaScript. These are our focus for the moment. 
11:35 - HTML has an index 
11:35 - the JS links to the index
11:36 - the engine the events the controller all connected to the HTML index page
11:37 - The CSS page(s) connected to all the HTML elements 
11:39 - Then we will need to connect the Images, they will be a 'resources' file
11:43 - What will people be clicking on? Classes the HTML Elements 
11:44 - We will be using w3 best practices 
11:44 - Visual Error in the visual 
11:49 - I should make this logger do more Markdown stuff. That would be cool. 
11:49 - Some side menu that Eric wants
11:51 - It will have issue highlights, Sam dislikes it
11:54 - Eric is convincing sam and I, Visual Studio Code will work
11:54 - We worked 3 hours 
12:35 - ls
[Thu 2016-10-20]

17:08 - Eric and Sam are going over the stuff that we went over yesterday when Sam was not here cause he was late to our last meeting.
