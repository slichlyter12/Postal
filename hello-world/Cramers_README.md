10:28 - downloaded Node.js
10:30 - 
10:42 - installed a code generator with 'npm install -g yo generator-code' 
10:42 - Then I ran the command code with the command 'yo code' 
10:43 - it led me through the creation instructions was made the skeleton of a code extention
10:46 - I opened the generated code in VS Code 
10:48 - Then I started debugging the code with F5
10:54 - Then running the Hello World command on the new Extension Developement Host window I was able to do the shift+command+P and run the hello world command and it printed out "Hello World!"
10:54 - *
