/*
* Ataraxer's Snake
*
* Recreation on classic "Snake" game. Player takes control of a snake
* which can grow by collecting (eating) pieces of food that appear in
* random place of a screen. Player controls snake movements by changing
* it's direction with w, a, s, d or arrow keys. Snakes automaticly moves 
* forward in current direction. To collect piece of food player have to
* move through it by directing snake's head to the piece. Every eaten piece
* of food increases the length of snake by 1 segment. If snake collides into
* any of it's own segments it's length decreases by 3 segmets. If snake's 
* length is smaller than 7 it's length will only decreas until it equals 4,
* granting that snake's length will always be at least 4 segments. Difficulty
* of game is being represented by quantity of snake's segment moved per second.
* For example difficulty level of 12 means that snake will move by one segment
* 12 times per second.
