* Class: Piece
* File: piece.h
*
* Piece class is a single element of a snake, or food piece.
* It's being represented by it's coordinates X and Y (fields
* myX and myY) in in-game coordinate scale. Piece's coordinates
* are being assigned at it's creation and can't be changed after.
*
* Interface:
*	X() - returns value of X coordinate of the segment.
*	Y() - returns value of Y coordinate of the segment.
