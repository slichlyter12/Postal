Ataraxer Snake: C++
===================

### Description ###

Recreation on classic "Snake" game. Player takes control of a snake
which can grow by collecting (eating) pieces of food that appear in
random place of a screen. Player controls snake movements by changing
it's direction with w, a, s, d or arrow keys. Snakes automaticly moves
forward in current direction. To collect piece of food player have to
move through it by directing snake's head to the piece. Every eaten piece
of food increases the length of snake by 1 segment. If snake collides into
any of it's own segments it's length decreases by 3 segmets. If snake's
length is smaller than 7 it's length will only decreas until it equals 4,
granting that snake's length will always be at least 4 segments. Difficulty
of game is being represented by quantity of snake's segment moved per second.
For example difficulty level of 12 means that snake will move by one segment
12 times per second.


Simple implementation of chess game in Scala programming language.
