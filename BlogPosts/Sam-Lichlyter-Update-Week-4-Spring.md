# This Week
This week we worked on our poster board for expo mainly. We went through a few iterations working with Kirsten and our client. Eric was the main design guy and the rest of us worked on the content of the poster. We didn't run into many issues other than a few communication issues which were worked out. 

# Next Week
Next week I imagine will mainly be our WIRED writing assignment.
