###What We Did This Week
This week our whole team met to discuss our problem statement revisions and to begin to think about what our requirements might look like. During the course of this meeting, we came to the conclusion that we would be better successful if we pivoted our tool towards two more specific categories: web developers and/or inexperienced developers. Previously we had aimed to tackle large scale projects with experienced developers, but we believe this would have been a problem for us time-wise and knowledge-wise. Additionally, it will be easier to test our tool with inexperienced developers (students) than more seasoned developers. We sent an email off to our client to notify him of our pivot (the details still meet all of his original requirements) and we hope and expect that he will approve them.

The team also meet with our TA, Vee, for the first time this week. We all became acquainted and he informed us of what he expects from us. The meeting went well and he believed our project and team were all currently in a good spot.

###Plans For Next Week
Next week we will finalize our problem statement and have it signed. The revisions will revolve around rewriting some of the specific terms to be in accordance with our pivot this last week, as well as adding citations to a source we had used for information. We will also begin and finish work on our requirements document, in accordance with the guidelines specified on the class website.
