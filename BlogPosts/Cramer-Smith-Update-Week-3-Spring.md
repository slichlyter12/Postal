# What We Did This Week

This week we worked on some minor bugs, we met with Kirsten about our poster, and we started working on getting demo projects for our user testing. This was difficult because we had to make two projects that were similar but not so similar that they had problems that were in the same or recognizable spots. We need the first test to not teach the user information of the second test. The Poster feedback we got was that we need less (more concise) text, and the pictures need to be a bit bigger. There were also some nitpicky changes that we hope to change.

# What We Plan To Do Next Week

This week we hope to make all the improvements on the poster and the get some bugs fixes for the extension and finish the demo projects and maybe even get some our friends to unofficial run through our tests and questionnaire to get an idea of how the tests run and how they feel to user and for us as testers, but we will see if we get that far.
