# This week
This week we met up to go over the progress we'd made since last week. Eric made some progress on the UI, Cramer made some progress on getting the editor to show the errors we find, Zach and I worked on the parser a bit to get our links working that didn't work last week. Zach and I are pretty close are getting the links to work as well as passing more data to the UI.

# Next Week
Next week I would like to get the UI to display nodes for directories we find in the main directory we're parsing.
