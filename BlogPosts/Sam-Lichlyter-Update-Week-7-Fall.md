This week I helped to create our "Hello World" extension in Visual Studio Code that would parse the directory in which the user was currently working and create an HTML document that listed all the files in their working directory. Our team also figured out how to take that HTML document and display it inline in the editor. We started working on it using JavaScript but we ultimately decided to go with TypeScript, which is Microsofts version of JavaScript, because almost all the examples of extensions used it. In the next few days we plan on finishing up our Technology Review. We have mostly been working in Visual Studio Code and JavaScript, but I think we should explore other options including other text editors such as Atom or Brackets. They are both similarly open sourced text editors.
