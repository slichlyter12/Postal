# What We Did

This week we focused on getting out a very simple first prototype for our client. We made a extension that displays all the files in the users work station. We also worked on splitting up the project into 4 main parts that each of us can 'specialize' in. We plan on working on these different parts and each of us splitting them up even more while writing the tech document. 

### The four parts are:
 * Graphic User Interphase
 * Files
 * Parser
 * Integrated Development Environment

We are still trying to figure out who is going to be a in charge of which part except Sam is probably going to use the parser.

I made a log of some of our meetings do you want it?

# What We Are Going To Do

The next week we are going to get our Tech document assignment done, do some research into other tools that might possibly be better for our project.
