This week we primarily worked on building out our design document. This was a lot hard than the previous documents as we had a bit of trouble trying to interpreter the IEEE standard. It was fairly vague in it's explanations. We later found out during our TA meeting that that was by design as a highly specific document might place constraints on a projects design. We also had a brief meeting with our client to discuss plans and deadlines for over break.

Next week we will be primarily working on our final report for the term and making plans for the next few weeks.
