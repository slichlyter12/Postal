**Week 3 Senior Project Work**

This week I worked on the problem statement, and thought about the design of the tool that we are planning to make.

We talked to our client about what he wanted and what he was looking for in our plan. We had some initial confusion about what we were supposed to do. Our client Christopher Scaffidi wants us to use IFT design patterns within a the tool. We were more focused on just making the tool itself. After talking to him we are on the same page. We will be using the tool and make a prototype that we might be able to test by the end of the year. 

Personally I was part of the conversation that about making the design, we are planning on having a code "tagging" system that will allow users to tag their code for the organization mechanism. This is not the final solution but it is the idea we have at the moment, and Chris thinks it's good. I also worked on the proposed solution part of our problem statement. That section still needs some polish, but I was assuming this is a rough draft. I tried to define what types of IFT design patterns we would be using within the tool we are creating and define some parts of IFT. I don't think that I was looking from the 10,000 foot level. I need to work on that in the future.

Thus far the tricky part of our project is that the 'problem' is just to use IFT. That is what our client wants. What we have proposed is not a problem but a solution. We want to implement this tool to prove that IFT within an application makes work easier, or at least test that it does. So that's what we are doing now. 

**For week 4**

We hope to maybe start working on our requirements, and resumes. I really want to get started on the coding of the project but I think we do that mostly in the winter? Would it be bad to start sooner?
