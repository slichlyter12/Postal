# What We Did This Week 

This week we worked on our problem statement final version. We only needed to add citation so it wasn't that bad. We also made some progress on our first HelloWorld Extension and making it look at the current files for the user. We also started our requirement document.

# Our Plan for Next Week

Next we plan to do more of our requirements document and make a lot more progress on our simple prototype.
