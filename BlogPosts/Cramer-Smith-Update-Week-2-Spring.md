# What We Did This Week

This week we worked on improving the UI for our client. We made it more responsive and improved the quality of information that is produced and shown on the UI. But with all this improvement we also introduced a number of bugs that will need to be addressed in the future. But with the improvements we showed our client we were able to get him satisfied with what we had and he said that we should start organizing a testing group that will try the extension and that we can get results from the tests and maybe publish the work. This meant we had to get certified by the IRB, so we worked on getting certified and working on creating a short questionnaire that we will use to quantify the results of the tests.

# What we plan to do this week

This week we hope to address some of the more pressing bugs and create two use cases that the people we will be experimenting on will be using during the test.
