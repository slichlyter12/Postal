This week we mostly focused on our user test development and our midterm review.

I sat down with a classmate on Friday and ran through both of our trail exams with him. 
it was a very useful experience as I found out that we hadn't written grammars for one of the tests yet, Needed to double our number of questions and the tester had actually found a bug in our test as well. There were some other smaller issues as well, like one of the project directories not having any TODOs in them despite having questions about them.

For the next week we will continue tuning our tests, making the above changes. I will also be making a few fixes in our code as well, I may add a reset button at the suggestion of our tester.
