This last week we began to implement the last few features for a close to finished version of postal. I worked a bit on fixings some bugs with the new node clustering system. Additionally I added the ability to see link information (line numbers) when links are selected. This was harder to do than I originally anticipated. The clustering system actually creates all new edges and nodes when things become clustered, so finding the correct objects to manipulate was a bit of a pain. Additionally I reintroduced file links as red lines but they will be changed again here relatively quickly.

Next I will be working on adding options for displaying file links, making sure our process bridge is working correctly and adding a couple of UI controls.
