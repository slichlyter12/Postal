# What I Would Do Different

We did a project! And now it is done. Looking back it was hard. If I were to change anything I would have told us how to design the thing prior to the attempted implementation. We had to redo the extension 3 times in a row to finally get it to the state that it is now. That was a giant headache that should have been avoided but sadly was not. It is hard to say that if we had had more time to design in the very beginning that we would have had more success in that specific implementation detail of making the parser, but I think it could have helped us figure out problems that we would have run into before hand.

# What I learned

I think that the biggest thing that I learned about myself during this year is how to make my ideas known to other people. I usually assume that other people are smarter than I am and I should really have more confidence in my thoughts. I have gone through the same courses and the have worked through a lot of similar problems, so my ideas and thoughts are valid. Even if I say something that isn't 100% correct that it is better to voice the idea and learn from the failure rather than not know and resent yourself for not speaking up. I think this is going to be extremely important in the real world of software development. If I ever want to get better I need to voice my ideas and try and sometimes fail. All those things are great.

# What I Like / Dislike

I like the idea of the project in general, but I am somewhat disappointed with the implementation. I think the idea of making a code visualization tool is super cool, but the way we did it is very clunky and kind of unsafe, in a software sense. Our extension opens another application to display the UI. To me, that just feels really bad, but we really had no other option. I think with more time we would have pivoted and changed to an IDE that would allow for a more integrated way of making custom UIs. It's too bad we couldn't do that but at the same time, we made a really cool project in a short amount of time. I really like the grammar system of our extension. It's really nice that the User can define grammars and make the extension work on any number of project, but it's complicated. The grammar system is really specific and is not well documented at the moment and for users to use the grammar system they have to do a bunch of complicated regexes. So I guess I more like the idea of the grammar system and not so much the implementation. 

# If I Were The Client

If I were the client I would not be too satisfied with the product. I think it is a great proof of concept, but Scaffidi wanted more of a "useful tool." We did not know that that is what we were trying to make until we were already mostly done with the project, so we were bootstrapping a bunch of features for users that until then we were not even thinking about the users. So I'm not sure it all came together that well.

# What to Work on Next year

We would need to fix all the small bugs and rework the displaying of the map. I think it would have to be a huge change to make the problems that I have with the extension currently go away. But with the work that has already been done it could be done in a school year. I think if a new team took it on they would be very lost in our code though.
