# What we did this week 

This week we made a design document. This made us look more into the details of our project and 'how' it was going to work. We also met with our client and showed him our most recent prototype. I feel like he was not happy. 

# What we plan todo next week

nothing have a nice break during finals, then during break we will work on getting the prototype working way better.
