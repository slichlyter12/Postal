This Week: 
1. The group wrote out the problem statement and spent a little time reworking the abstract. 

2. Began discussing basic design of how Postal will work and made sure that the project was going to be feasible.

3. Just today we sat down with Chris and discussed expectations of the project. It surprised me that we might actually get a chance to run a study with actual people. REUs FTW. 

4. Scheduled the next four weeks. Mostly list what we wanted to have accomplished when and reserved rooms. We're not at the point yet where we're ready to divide up jobs so we'll be working together for the next two weeks at least.


Next Week: 

By the end of the next week we'd like to have our requirements nailed down and start to draft out our design for the system.
