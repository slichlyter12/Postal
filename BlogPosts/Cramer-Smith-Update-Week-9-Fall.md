# What I did This Week

Not a whole lot. I did look around the documentation for VSCode and started to think about the design document. That is truly what spurred the curiosity to look further into the specific documentation of VSCode. I am worried we won't know enough to write a fully fledged design document. I hope to look into this more during the break and will try to do some programming this week. 

# Plan for Next Week

We plan to start and finish the design document, and work a lot on our actua project. I feel as though working on the design document should fuel the work on the actual program.
