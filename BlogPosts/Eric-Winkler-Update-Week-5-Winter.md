We spent this last week developing and working towards a plan to provide a public release of Postal on the extension marketplace. This release will not be entirely feature complete but we'd like to have feedback on what we currently have working by the end of the month. Our plan is to finish all functionality short of errors, release what we have on Monday (2/20) and during that week finish errors and solicit feed back from both the market place and personal connections. 

I will be focusing on cleaning up the UI and getting the nodes in a hierarchy arrangement. We came to the conclusion that displacing both links in terms of includes and hyperlinks as well as displaying links that indicate a node's position in the project directory was overwhelming. This is especially true in a web like configuration of nodes. Instead, we will display the nodes in a directory based hierarchy where the links displayed by default will be indicative of the node's position in the project directory. When a node is clicked on, the links that indicate a connect between files (includes/hyperlinks) will then be rendered.
