This week we spent a lot of time discussing design and prototyping. 
We started to really nail down the design of our 'file map'. Ideally, it will look like a big web of files that we can zoom into but should the zooming prove too difficult, we also have an alternate design set up. We're a little worried the file map might be overwhelming in terms of information being displayed to the user but otherwise we're happy with the direction we're planning to take.

Additionally, we spent a good chunk of time prototyping a visual studio code in preparation for a meeting we had on Thursday. We built an application that basically parsed for all the files in the current directory and returned it as html within a separate column in vs code. This got us over A LOT of technical humps we we're worried with.

Our meeting with Chris went well. He gave us a pretty elegant architecture to set up our extension with which naturally divided into four big tasks we could each take responsibility for.
