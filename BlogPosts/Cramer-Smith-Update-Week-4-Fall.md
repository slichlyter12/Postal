# Week 4

## What I did

This week I worked with the team to help define the the problem statement more and start to think about some more basic requirements. I also started looking more at the Visual Studio Code that we are planning to use as the basis of our extension. I was able to easily make a 'hello world' of the extension. And I made my own branch and logged the meeting with a python script that I made it's fun it is working nicely. I need to add some markdown implementation, but I am feeling lazy at the moment. I put it in my HelloWorld Branch.

We met on Wednesday, and worked for three hours hashing out different requirements and the problem statement. 

## Our Plan For Next Week

Next week we plan to work on the revision of the problem statement and get that finalized, and go to the career fair. We also plan to go work on the requirements more and I will probably work on expanding the hello world extension.
