##What We Did This Week
The entirety of this week was spent completing the design document. We all met earlier in the week to define what each team member would write about. We each tackled the general scope of the components we discussed in our Tech Review last week. I covered the data handling portion, that is, the data structure, serialization of the data, and storage of the data into a JSON file. These components were introduced and discussed in light of their respective design viewpoints, according to the IEEE 1016-2009 document. Additionally, we met with our client Chris to discuss the progress we've made thus far, as well as our plan over winter break.

##Plans For Next Week
During finals week, we plan to write our progress reports for the term and create a verbal presentation of those reports. We are confident that the report will be thoroughly completed by the due date on Wednesday. Post finals week, we will continue to work on our VS Code extension over the break, and plan to have a rough prototype with parsing and UI completed by the beginning of Winter term.
