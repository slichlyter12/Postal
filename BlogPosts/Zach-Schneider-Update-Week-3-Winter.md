##What We Did This Week
This week was a relatively slow week for most of the team. We met with Vee on Monday to discuss where we were on our progress and then met as a team afterward to see where each member was on their individual tasks. We are all content with the progress we've made so far, but all agree that February will require a bit more work time put in. We still aim to have a fully functional prototype by the end of February.

##Plans For Next Week
Next week should see significantly more work done, as we're all pretty busy with other concerns this week and on the weekend. I plan to rework the creation of file nodes so that links will be correctly supported for Eric's UI, and I will work with Sam and the file parser to ensure this is done sustainably.
