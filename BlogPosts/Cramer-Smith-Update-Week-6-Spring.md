# What We Did This Week

This week we finished up our user test testing, and use cases. And we gave our extension to some people to try our testing. The Problem we had is that we should have probably had this done last week, we are behind schedule a bit. But it's weird cause we aren't worried about the class anymore. We know that we will be fine for Expo and all the write-ups that need to happen. But for our client, we are probably behind, but not enough to be worrisome. 

# What We Plan To Do Next Week

Getting the people to test our tests was really good we now know that we need to change and we will probably be adding the finishing touches to the tests and then ask our client for some feedback on the test and then we will hopefully survive expo. We will also be making our progress report.
