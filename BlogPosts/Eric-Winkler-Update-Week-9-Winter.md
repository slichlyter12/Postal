This week we planned on implementing a character by character parser but instead opted for a sort of priority base parser that reads in the entire file. This allow us to write grammars for things that may appear on multiple lines like for c-function definitions. Additionally we began the process of switching over to a clustering method for our UI nodes and Zach worked on UI controls.
