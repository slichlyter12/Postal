##What We Did This Week
Each team member worked towards producing an initial prototype extension for VS Code to display all subfolders and files in a project directory. This "Hello World" example was shown to our client during a meeting with him Thursday. Chris seemed satisfied with our progress so far, but also gave a few suggestions as to what direction each team member should take going forward. My primary responsibility for now will be to research and start developing a method to serialize and store parsed project file data within some kind of database. This will make it so our project parser does not have to re-parse the entire code project every time a file is changed. This research goes hand in hand with the technology review document we started this week. Each member has divided up various areas of interest/technologies to research and report on for use in our project. We expect to finish this document over the weekend. 

##Plans For Next Week
Aside from finishing the tech review document, we will begin to take a hard look at the overall design of our extension. We will continue to meet and prototype as a team to get a better idea of how we want to implement various features, and will compile these decisions in our design document that is due finals week.
