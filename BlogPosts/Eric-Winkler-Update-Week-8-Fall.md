This Week we spent time discussing what our shared data structure will look like moving forward. This data structure will primarily be used by Sam and myself; Sam gathering the data and me using it.

Additionally we spent some time finishing up our tech review. We discussed the options each of use researched and made a few decisions about what technologies we'll be using. As far as I'm aware, we are still sticking with VS code and Typescript as our primary technologies, and using a JSON file for data storage.

Next week we should be doing a bit more prototyping and working on our presentation and poster board.
