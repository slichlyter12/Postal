# This Week
This week we updated a lot of our documents as per requested by Kevin including the Tech Review and the Design Document. This was good because enough had changed in our design that our old design document was out of date. This weekend, we sat down and refactored our entire extension. It is now more reliable and actually has more features than it had before we started this weekend. 

# Next Week
Next week we will work on our Progress Report because it was extended a week by Kevin for us because we wanted to get our extension on the VSCode Extension Marketplace as soon as possible. We will also work on uploading our extension to the marketplace and finishing up the refactors by tomorrow evening.
