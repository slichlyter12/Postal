## This Week

This week we implemented c-like functions. This allows our tool to visualize c-like functions similar to the way we visualize divs and links in our web projects. We also tried to implement a character-by-character parser, but we decided we could rework our current parser to parse the whole file at once and still get the same features we wanted out of a character-by-character parser. We also started on clustering our nodes.

## Next Week

Next week we plan on getting our clustering to completely work as well as some other basic features like navigating to the users code when they click on links, not parsing the user's comments, and getting a .postalignore working so they can specify which files they don't want our extension to parse.
