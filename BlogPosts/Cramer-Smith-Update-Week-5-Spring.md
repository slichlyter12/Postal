# What We Did This Week

We finished all the features of the extension in anticipation of the code freeze on Monday. So we added 1) The highlighted nodes 2) the navigate to code on notification click. Besides that, we worked on a Wired Article for Senior Design. We wanted to get more work done on the test cases for our experiment but after the code freeze we lost some motivation and took a break. 

# What We Plan To Do this Week

We hope to finish up the use cases for our experiment than get some of our friends to try out the extension and run the user case study with them to test the test.
