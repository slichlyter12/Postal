This week we haven't yet committed much time to the project. The plan is to begin work on a first version of the file map within the next couple of days. The goals of this first version will be to read in test data from a build of our current shared data structure and render them as objects with Visual Studio code. We are planning on starting off with vis.js and moving through our other options until we find something that will work within the VS code environment.
