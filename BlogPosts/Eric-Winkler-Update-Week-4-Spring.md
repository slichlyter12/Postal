This week I primarily worked on our poster board. Kirsten asked that I write up a list of design tips for other groups which she seemed to appreciate. Unfortunately, the design I worked on violated a couple a guidelines so I had to revert back to an older version and submit a modified version of that.

We also produced a basic list of questions that will eventually become our questionnaire for user testing. We sent the list to our client for suggestions.

Our plan is to make some last minute fixes this week and to also do a couple of test runs with people we know using the above mentioned questions we produced for our client.
