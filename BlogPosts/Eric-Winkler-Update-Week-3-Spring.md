This week the team continued forward with our plans to prepare for testing. Our client has a hold of our certificates for IRB approval and our list of questions. He suggested that we begin prototyping the trials for the test and have a rough draft of the experiment by next Monday. We plan on completing this this weekend. 

I also had a quick meeting with Eugene Zhang looking for feedback on our UI. He has some pretty good ideas as to how to make the UI a bit more intuitive and also put me in contact with Yue Zhang. I will be meeting with her next week to get some feedback on the project as well.

This weekend I also plan on doing a redesign of our poster as a result of a feedback meeting we had today.
