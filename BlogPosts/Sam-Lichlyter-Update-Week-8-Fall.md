This week we finished up our Tech Review document and figured out a lot of the technologies we will be using throughout our project. The main piece I will be in charge of for our product is the file parser. I learned through our tech review that using regular expressions, which was my original plan, probably won't be enough to parse through real world HTML code. For this reason I have decided we will need to write a Perl script and use some of the already built HTML parser modules to find the tags that we want to check for. One of the Perl parsers will also allow us to check against the W3C standards so we can flag the users code for where they essentially "broke the rules." This module will also allow us to turn it off and check against how most browsers actually render the code since how the browser renders the markup and how the W3C specifies it should be rendered are sometimes different.
