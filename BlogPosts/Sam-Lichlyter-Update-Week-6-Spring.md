# This Week
This week we sat down with a few people to go over our user tests before we went through the actual IRB approved tests. This way we could fix any mistakes we had in our tests. We also starting putting together our progress report and video. One thing we haven't done is nail down our expo pitch with needs to happen soon. Unfortunately we are pretty good at getting across what our extension does to other developers but not the average joe. Personally I'm also struggling on relating our extension to younger kids.

# Next Week
Next week we are going to wrap up our progress report on Monday and prepare for expo the rest of the week. I have full confidence in our ability to be prepared for expo by Friday.
