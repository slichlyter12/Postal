# What We Did

We continued work on the large todo list that we feel we need to have finished by the time of actual release, and we are making progress. I specifically working on the process bridge that will connect the electron terminal to the Vscode IDE. 

# What We Plan To Do

With Spring break finally here I think some of us are going to take a small break. I myself think I will try to get the process bridge working and have the users be able to navigate to the code from the electron window, but we will see if I will be able to accomplish that.
