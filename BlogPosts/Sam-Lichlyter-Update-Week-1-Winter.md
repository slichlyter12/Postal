# Winter Break
Over winter break we tried to get a lot of the development done while we had some extra free time. The UI logic that Eric was working on is pretty close to being finished, I worked a bit on the parsers over break but didn't make a ton of headway until this week actually. 

# This Week
Like I said, this week I made significant progress on the parsers. I worked mainly on getting data from each of the files we were parsing and Zach and Cramer worked on taking the data I had found and serializing it into a JSON data structure that our UI could read. Before we had pretty separate pieces all doing different things, but this week we put them all together so they could all communicate which tied up our project pretty nicely. 

We also met with our client this week to catch up on our progress over the break and decided where we would go from here.

# Moving Forward
Looking to the rest of the term we still have a few feature we need to implement like getting the links between our nodes to show up, I know we're actually really close on this. Our client gave us some pretty good advice about hooking up our parser logic to the UI and how our users should interact with our tool. We also talked about timelines and what milestones we should aim for within the next couple of months.
