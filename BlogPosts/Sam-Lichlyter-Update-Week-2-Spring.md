# This Week 
This week we worked on fixing minor bugs within our tool. For example we had some UI that was a little wonky that we fixed up, we also still have a bug that catches if, else, while, etc. blocks as functions when defined in TypeScript. But mostly minor bugs like this were taken care of this week. We also met with our client again to to talk about IRB testing. This went well and we have a plan to move forward in the coming weeks to get testers.

# Next Week
Next week we plan on fixing smaller bugs for our tool, but I think mostly our focus will be on the poster board that's coming due soon.
