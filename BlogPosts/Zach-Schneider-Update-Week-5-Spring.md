## What We Did This Week
This week the team wrapped up all code commits by the Monday night code freeze. We confirmed that we met all requirements and had fixed most bugs. We pushed these changes to our VS Code extension on Microsoft's extension marketplace. We are happy with the state our project is in and look forward to getting user feedback. Additionally, I submitted the team's expo poster by the deadline. 

Individually, I met up with my assigned WIRED article partner and interviewed him about his project. I reviewed his project in the style of a WIRED article and submitted it to Kirsten by Friday. 

## Plans for Next Week
Next week the team will get started on our midterm progress report. The only uncertainty left for us is when the IRB testing proposal will be approved and when we will conduct our user testing.
