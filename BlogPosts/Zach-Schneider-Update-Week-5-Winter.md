##What We Did This Week
This week I began to wrap up node creation in the data structure portion of our project. The display of href links between nodes has continued to be tricky, and isn't fully featured or functional yet, but I believe this can be added to over time. The rest of the team worked on their respective portions as well.

##Plans for Next Week
Once we are in a good place concerning the actual project, the team will convene to work on revising the tech review and design document. Tech review should be short and sweet, while the design doc may take some serious reevaluation. Kevin allowed us an extension for our progress report in light of our attempt at a beta release by Week 7 instead of 11. The progress report will be completed by the end of Week 7 instead.
