##What We Did This Week
This week each team member spent most of their time on individual work on adding features to the project. I worked on adding configuration buttons to the UI that allow the user to dynamically change the shape and physics of our information network. Later, I began working on the UI for the list of errors that our parsers will detect in each file. Lastly, the team began making preparations for our progress report video and preliminary poster due next week.

##Plans For Next Week
Next week we will meet to put together the basic version of our Expo poster, deciding what points we want to hit and how we want to display our UI. Additionally, we will continue adding minor features to our project, such as the error list.
