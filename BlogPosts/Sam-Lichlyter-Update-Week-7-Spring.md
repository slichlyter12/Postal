# This Week
Most of this week consisted of preparing for expo and then actually being at expo. We put the last final touches on our pitch and gave it all we had.

# Expo
Expo was great, we met a lot of people who were interested in our project and our tool. We got a few people who asked if we were looking for jobs after this term. Being recently accepted into grad school, I unfortunately had to say no to a few people but said I would reach out when I graduate. Eric I believe got a few peoples names.

# A Retrospective
If I were to redo this project from the beginning, I would definitely put more time into the planning stages as well as more communication with our client. I think with those two combined we could have developed less and designed more and turned out a better product as well as relieving some frustration along the way. One of the biggest things I learned was how to work in a group effectively while still maintaining friendships. That I think is a valuable skill I will use in the workplace in the future. I am proud of the product we turned out, I am more impressed by the logic behind it than the visual aspect of it, just because it is so adaptable.
