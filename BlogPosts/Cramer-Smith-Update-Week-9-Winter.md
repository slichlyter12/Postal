# What we did this week.

Almost nothing. We worked some this weekend we now have C functions working. That makes our parser way more useful to me personally. 

# What we plan to do next week

Next week there are a number of things that we need to do. We have to do our progress report again and make a video thing for that. We also hope to have our project entirely done by the end of this quarter so we will probably work on the final touches of our extension and get it up on the marketplace and see if we can get some actual users.
