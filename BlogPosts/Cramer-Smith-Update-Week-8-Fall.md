# What We Did This Week

We spent a lot of time working on the tech document. I specifically worked on the sections:
* IDE: looked at the Brackets, Atom, and VSCode
* Language: looked at TypeScript and Javascript
* Event Handling: looked at htmlpreview, event emitters, and the built in events.
I learned a lot about Visual Studio Code which was really nice I feel like I don't know a lot about VSCode.

# What we plan on doing next week
We plan to start our design doc ASAP, and work a little more on our prototypes.
