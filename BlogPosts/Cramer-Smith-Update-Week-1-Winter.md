# What We Did

This week we met with our Client and showed him our first prototype. It was not to the point that we wanted but he seemed very happy with the results and gave us some good feedback and advice for the future. 

We did a lot of work toward getting our extension into an actual working product. Previously we had three different parts and now they are finally coming together. But the bring these parts together was more work than we initially thought it would be. There was a lot of debugging and a lot of frustration, but we are quickly getting much closer to our end goal.

# What We Plan to Do

This next week we are going to crank it down a notch. We don't have a deadline from our client until the end of february and we should be able to work more slow and steady rather than this weeks full pace non stop. But we will keep working on it.
