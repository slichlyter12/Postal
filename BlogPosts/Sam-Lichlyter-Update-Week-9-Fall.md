This week being a long holiday weekend I didn't work on a whole lot beforehand. I do plan on looking over everything we need for the parser and how to build one. Also at a more basic level I plan on looking over some Perl tutorials to get a better handle on the language. 

Next week we plan on working on our Design Document and finishing it up as well as another meeting with our client.
