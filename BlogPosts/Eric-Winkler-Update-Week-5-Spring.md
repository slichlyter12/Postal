This week we began finishing features in preparation for the code freeze. I focused on fixing a couple bugs and getting individual nodes to highlight when the user hovered over a notification in the notification list. 

We also released a 1.0 on the VScode store which has a ton of improvements since our last push. 

We also began to make some progress on user testing by finding pre-test subjects and creating a first draft of a test form.

We still have a lot of work to do creating the test environment. Our form calls for a couple projects for the users to run Postal on involving some pretty specific functionality. We're having a little trouble finding directories to use and may have to make some ourselves.

Next week we will continue developing our user test forms.
