## This Week
I started to move our extension to an MVC framework. To do this I basically took a lot of the functionality we had and "functionalized" our code into a controller class. This will also help Zach out with his asynchronous issues he's having so he can just call one of these functions when he needs to instead of having to other workarounds.

## Next week
Next week I will continue moving things over to MVC.
