This week we revised our problem statement. In doing so we focused more on web developers and refined the goals of our product to reflect that. We decided to create a more visual component which we could use to convey the structure of the users code in a more understandable format. 

We also met with our TA, Vee, who gave us some advice on how we should approach the class and our teammates. Being pretty close friends I think we'll be okay and we've had excellent communication in the past, so I'm not too worried about this. 

We started thinking about our requirements and the requirements document which we plan on working this weekend.
