## This Week
This week we continued to work on our extension. The biggest thing was we uploaded it to the Microsoft Visual Studio Code Marketplace so we could get users feedback on it. So far we haven't heard from any users on the store but we have given it to a few of our friends to test it out for us. We fixed some bugs related to the store and some general ones we didn't realize were there until we gave it to people. 

We also put together our progress report this week.

## Next Week
Next week we have a meeting with our client and we also plan on pushing some more bug fixes to the store.
