# This week
This week I got a little more time to work on the parser than last week, but I still didn't get the directories to show up. I think I will hand this off to Zach because he seems to be working more with this data than I am at the moment. I'm going to move on for now and switch our program to a more defined Model View Controller design pattern. Eric has started creating a controller, I just need to refactor the code we wrote for the VSCode extension itself. 

# Next Week
Moving our extension to MVC might take a little longer, so I will also work on this next week.
