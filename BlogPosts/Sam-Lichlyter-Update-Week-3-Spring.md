# This Week
This week we met with Kirsten to review our poster and another group's poster. We also started working on our user tests for our IRB testing. We also finished all of our IRB certification this week. We didn't really run into any problems other than things we needed to fix on our poster which we just got that feedback today. 

# Next Week
Next week we plan on continuing working on our user test.
