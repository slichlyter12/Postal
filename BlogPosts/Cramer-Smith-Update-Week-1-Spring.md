# What We Did Last Week

We had spring break and we all worked somewhat sporadically over the break, not that much though. Then we got back to school and we met on Monday and worked on some bugs and features that needed to be added. We got those to a working stage and then we met with our client on Tuesday. This meeting went poorly. He really wanted progress on the UI and we haven't been focusing on the UI as much as the functionality. That was disappointing, but with what we have set up already we feel we can make the changes he wants to see by our next meeting. So those changes are what we have been working on.

# What We Plan To Do 

This next week we meet with our client and hopefully show him a better UI. If that meeting goes well he will start gathering funds for testing and get us started on making good experiments for users. We also will continue to squash the numerous bugs that we are running into with the extension.
