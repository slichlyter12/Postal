This week I mostly focused on getting our electron/node GUI to launch when it is called from the vs code extension. It's not quite working yet, but I believe I'm getting close. I've been looking into a node module called process-bridge which should help out with this problem.

I hope to be done with this next week and also start on the dig down refactor and styling the window.
