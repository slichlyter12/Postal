### What We Did This Week
This week was one of logistics and clarification. Sam set up our GitHub repo called Project Postal (a weird name, I know) and each of us made a few initial commits to it. I set up the Latex document for our problem statement, so we will have a .tex template file for future documents. We scheduled the meeting time with our TA, Vee, for Fridays at noon. We won't meet with him this week but will in week 4. We have also be in email contact with Prof. Scaffidi, our project sponsor. He has been clarifying some information for us as we wrote our problem statement. We had some initial confusion as to whether the research aspect of our project was the focus, or if the tool we would be developed would simply use principals of the IFT research. Turns out it's a little bit of both, but I think we all have a clearer understanding at the end of this week. Finally, this Friday we are having our first in-person meeting with Prof. Scaffidi to get the problem statement signed and some expectations established for this project. I may update this post if there is information of note from that meeting.

### Plans For Next Week
For the class, we were asked to prepare our resumes to bring in, so I will be updated my existing resume this weekend. Besides that, we have no immediate instructions specifically related to our project. As such, we will do as instructed in class Tuesday.
