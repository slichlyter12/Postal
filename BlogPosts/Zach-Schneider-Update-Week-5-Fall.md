## What We Did This Week
This week the team completed the final version of our problem stated. We added a citations, subject headings, and revised a few lines concerning how we will test our software tool. We also began work on our requirements document. A rough draft has been submitted as of Friday, with the majority of the required sections within the document completed. We still need to nail down some specifics regarding the actual functions within our tool, as well as the operations the user will perform within our tool. 

We met with Vee this week and simply checked in our progress with him. There was nothing specific we needed to do coming away from that meeting, other than making general progress on our documents.

## Plans For Next Week
We will continue to iterate through versions of our requirements document, completing and signing the final version by Friday 11/4. We will meet as a team to discuss the details still needed, and we will await and address and corrections as noted by the professors for this class.
