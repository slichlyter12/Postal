## What We Did This Week
This week we met with out client to check in with our progress. We had a bit of a misunderstanding of work focus: we had been polishing off features whereas he wanted us to focus on polishing the UI. As such, we will meet again next week to check our progress again. Various features were worked on this week, mostly related to the UI. We created a number of event listeners that allow users to click on our node network and be directed to the corresponding line of code in their project. Additionally, we created a TypeScript grammar that will allow us to visualize our own project, as it is the main coding project we actually all work on day to day.

## Plans for Next Week
We will continue polishing the UI to get it up to our client's expectations. We have a meeting with him on Tuesday to see if the work is to his liking. After that, we will see if there is time/resources available to conduct user testing.
