# Week 3

This week I set up our GitHub page (welcome), I also worked on our problem statement along with the rest of the team. I have been our main contact with our client, Chris, since he and I have worked together for the past year on similar research projects. This week we sat down with Chris to discuss some of the specifics of the project and to form a rough outline of what he wants to see and when.

Earlier in the week we hammered out a few of the main design decisions for our tool and how we expect the user to interact with it, along with what tools we will be using to build ours, and what languages we want to support at first launch.

Next week we plan on getting our requirements document in a near finished state.
