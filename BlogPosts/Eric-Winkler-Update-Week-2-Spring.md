This week we continued to adjust postal to better fit our client's needs in anticipation of a meeting we had on Tuesday. He was happy with the improvements we had made and was also pleased that we were using the tool on our own time. We began to make plans for testing and created a new timeline for the group. In the next few days the team will get IRB certified and create a list of questions that will eventually become our end of test questionnaire. I personally will be working on a couple of bugs I noticed as well.
