## What We Did This Week

This week we worked on the Requirements document. While doing this we were forced to make a lot of decisions about the project that we have been needing to make. We were faced with a lot of requirements that we had to define that were previously undefined. I hope that we haven't set ourselves up for failure. 

## What We Plan To Do Next Week

With the next week we hope to get a small prototype done for our client, to prove that we have made progress in the development side. We also want to get some paper prototyping done so that we can get a better idea of what we want the application to look like. We also need to do the tech document. I think that is what it is called.
