# This Week:
This week we spent a chunk of time revisiting our problem statement and started a plan for the rest of the term. We set up a schedule for team meetings which will be weekly. We also spent a good chunk of time discussing basic requirements and touched on the design of our tool. We were mostly attempting to reassure ourselves that our project was feasible and made sense. The result of the discussion was a narrowing of our project's scope.

# Next Week:
We're planning on having a completed(ish) version of our requirements done by the end of next week. Additionally we may spend a bit more time familiarizing ourselves with visual studio code its extension system.
