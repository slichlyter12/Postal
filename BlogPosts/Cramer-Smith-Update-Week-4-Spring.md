# What We Did This Week.

We had to finish up the bug-crunching and adding the last small features to our extension in expectation of the code freeze. That approaching this coming up on Monday. The major requirements that we had to complete were:

1. be able to parse a large project quickly. We haven't tested that. 
2. Be able to hover over notification list and highlight node where it is located.
3. Be able to click on the list and navigate to the code area.

We were able to test the large project, but the tests need to be more extensive at this moment. 

# What We Plan To Do Next week

This weekend we plan on implementing the other two features and they should be very easy to implement given that all the ground work is in place. We are not worried about the code freeze except for proving that we can parse a large project really quickly.
