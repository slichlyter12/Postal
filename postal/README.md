# postal README

The Goal of Poastal is to help developers organize code by creating a visual representation of code and the way that they connect, and relate with each other. 

## Features

The best feature of Postal is the ability to create a visual representation of the file and the way that they connect to one another.  


In the current build of postal is configured for small web projects consisting of mainly HTML CSS and JavaScript, but can be configured for different types of projects. 

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
