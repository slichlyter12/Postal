\section{Overview}

% 1.1 
\subsection{Scope}
This document will cover the entirety design of the Postal extension written for the Visual Studio Code integrated development environment. 
The focus of the design will be on the four main parts of the extension, and the use of Information Foraging Theory within the extension.
The four parts of the extension design are the parser, the data structure, the interface with Visual Studio Code and the user interface.
The document with go through each of these parts and describe in detail how each will be implemented and how each part will function.
The Information Foraging Theory Patters that are planned to be explored within the extension are the Specification Matcher, Structural Relatedness, Impact Location, Path Search, and Recollection.
The document will go into more detail as to what these patterns mean and how they will influence the design of the extension.

% 1.2
\subsection{Purpose}
This design document describes the planned design and steps for implementing the Postal extension for Visual Studio Code. 
The team implementing the design will use this document as the blueprint for the implementation of the extension. 

% 1.3
\subsection{Intended Audience}
This document is meant for the design stakeholders. 
The design stake holders includes the team implementing the extension, their client, and their supervisors. 
The teams supervisors being the people grading the project on the implementation of the designs described within this document.


% 1.4 
\subsection{Conformance}
The document conforms to the IEEE Std 1016-2009.

\newtheorem{MVC}{Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern assigns objects in an application one of three roles: model, view, or controller. The pattern defines not only the roles objects play in the application, it defines the way objects communicate with each other. Each of the three types of objects is separated from the others by abstract boundaries and communicates with objects of the other types across those boundaries. The collection of objects of a certain MVC type in an application is sometimes referred to as a layerâ€”for example, model layer.\cite{appleMVC}}

\section{Conceptual Model for Software Design Descriptions}
The software will be loosely written with a model view control design pattern.
It is loosely MVC because it is an extension and some of the view will be out of the control of the extension, but the main parts of the extension will fill these roles .
The model will be the data structure that we will use to represent the parsed files. 
The view will be the user interface and the integrated development environment.
The IDE and the user interface that the extension creates will be the view and act dependent of each other.
The control will be the event handlers that are

\subsection{Software Design in Context}
The extension is supposed to help novice web developer with organizing and create cleaner HTML and CSS code. 
To accomplish this the design of the extension it will contain a UI, a number of parsers for the different languages.
The parsers and the extensions will need to communicate between each other and VSC.
This communication will be facilitated by a datastructer that will also allow for a
